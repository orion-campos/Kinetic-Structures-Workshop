  Lightning System Triggered by 

  The architectural project consisted of a canopy for a public street. To give the function of a streetlight to the element, it was thought a lightning system that would be attached to this canopy, giving it an additional function.
  The lights would be turned on automatically after evening, by a series of light sensors reading the environment light.
  Concept of project done by Sapir Dror and Eran Damari under the tuition of Orion Campos, at the Kinetic Structures Workshop, Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Department of Architecture.
