  Blink

  Turns on an LED on and off repeatedly.
  It is possible to use the on-board LED. Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO it is attached to digital pin 13.
  If desired, a 5mm LED can be used on digital pin 13. If so, it is not necessary to use a resistor, since the pin 13 allready has a resistor attached.

  Output:
  1x 5mm LED
  1x 560Î© resistor (if the digital pin 13 is not used)
