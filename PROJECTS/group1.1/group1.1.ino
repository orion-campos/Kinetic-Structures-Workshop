  Opening Mechanism Triggered by Humidity

  Create a module of an opening mechanism for a building facade, which would open if the internal humidity is higher than 60%, enabling the air circulation inside the building to improve the environment comfort, and closing if the internal humidity is less than 60% to preserve the interior atmosphere.
  For optimization of the materials and movable pieces, each module would be opened by only one strong servo (DF15 Metal Gear Servo - 15kg). This servo would rotate four cables at the same time, which would then open four different paper tentacles covered with a light and elastic white fabric that covers the paper tentacles and the cables,givingg structuralstrengthh to the module.
  Concept of project done by Michal Weintraub and Doron Winter under the tuition of Orion Campos, at the Kinetic Structures Workshop, Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Department of Architecture.
