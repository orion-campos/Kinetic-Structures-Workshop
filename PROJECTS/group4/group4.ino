  Grasshopper triggered by Light

  Create a physical model of a crystal made of laser-cut thick paper, which geometry was also modeled parametrically using Grasshopper 3D.
  At 4 faces of the crystal, were installed 4 photoresistors that read the amount of light through an Arduino <https://www.arduino.cc/>. Grasshopper receives this value through the Firefly pluggin  <http://www.fireflyexperiments.com/>, which translates through the code to colors at a virtual model of the same physical crystal model.
  Concept of project done by Itay Stoler under the tuition of Orion Campos, at the Kinetic Structures Workshop, Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Department of Architecture. Jerusalem, January 7th to 14th, 2018

  Input:
  4x Photo cell (CdS photoresistor)
  4x 10KÎ© resistor
