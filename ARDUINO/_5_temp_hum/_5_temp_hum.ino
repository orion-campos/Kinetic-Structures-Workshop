/*
  Temperature and Humidity Sensor

  Connect the DHT-22, also named as AM2302, a relative humidity and temperature sensor to an Arduino, and turn on an LED with an 'IF' statement.
  In this code the LED turn on if the relative humidity is higher than 70%, which could be achieved by breathing very closely to the sensor.
  Display the read values on the Serial Monitor.

  Input:
  1x DHT-22 (AM2302)
  1x 10KΩ resistor
  Output:
  1x 5mm LED
  1x 220Ω resistor
